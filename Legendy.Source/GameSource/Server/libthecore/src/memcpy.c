/* Original comments from mplayer (file: aclib.c) This part of code
   was taken by me from Linux-2.4.3 and slightly modified for MMX, MMX2,
   SSE instruction set. I have done it since linux uses page aligned
   blocks but mplayer uses weakly ordered data and original sources can
   not speedup them. Only using PREFETCHNTA and MOVNTQ together have
   effect!

   From IA-32 Intel Architecture Software Developer's Manual Volume 1,

  Order Number 245470:
  "10.4.6. Cacheability Control, Prefetch, and Memory Ordering Instructions"

  Data referenced by a program can be temporal (data will be used
  again) or non-temporal (data will be referenced once and not reused
  in the immediate future). To make efficient use of the processor's
  caches, it is generally desirable to cache temporal data and not
  cache non-temporal data. Overloading the processor's caches with
  non-temporal data is sometimes referred to as "polluting the
  caches".  The non-temporal data is written to memory with
  Write-Combining semantics.

  The PREFETCHh instructions permits a program to load data into the
  processor at a suggested cache level, so that it is closer to the
  processors load and store unit when it is needed. If the data is
  already present in a level of the cache hierarchy that is closer to
  the processor, the PREFETCHh instruction will not result in any data
  movement.  But we should you PREFETCHNTA: Non-temporal data fetch
  data into location close to the processor, minimizing cache
  pollution.

  The MOVNTQ (store quadword using non-temporal hint) instruction
  stores packed integer data from an MMX register to memory, using a
  non-temporal hint.  The MOVNTPS (store packed single-precision
  floating-point values using non-temporal hint) instruction stores
  packed floating-point data from an XMM register to memory, using a
  non-temporal hint.

  The SFENCE (Store Fence) instruction controls write ordering by
  creating a fence for memory store operations. This instruction
  guarantees that the results of every store instruction that precedes
  the store fence in program order is globally visible before any
  store instruction that follows the fence. The SFENCE instruction
  provides an efficient way of ensuring ordering between procedures
  that produce weakly-ordered data and procedures that consume that
  data.

/*  mmx v.1 Note: Since we added alignment of destinition it speedups
    of memory copying on PentMMX, Celeron-1 and P2 upto 12% versus
    standard (non MMX-optimized) version.
    Note: on K6-2+ it speedups memory copying upto 25% and
          on K7 and P3 about 500% (5 times).
*/

/* Additional notes on gcc assembly and processors: [MF]
   prefetch is specific for AMD processors, the intel ones should be
   prefetch0, prefetch1, prefetch2 which are not recognized by my gcc.
   prefetchnta is supported both on athlon and pentium 3.

   therefore i will take off prefetchnta instructions from the mmx1
   version to avoid problems on pentium mmx and k6-2.

   quote of the day:
    "Using prefetches efficiently is more of an art than a science"
